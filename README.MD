This project modifies VRTK 3.2.1 to use it with the Vive Focus. It replaces the Daydream SDK with the WaveVR SDK. It was made in Unity 2017.3.0.

I made this a long time ago, so I'm not sure which scripts I edited, but I do remember I changed the core VRTK_SDK_Manager. Running a compare with the original VRTK 3.2.1 should help you find all the changes. My scenes are in the Scenes folder.

I originally posted the relevant filed and screenshots on the Viveport forum, but that forum was moved to the Vive Forum, and the attachments weren't moved along with the rest of the forum. But please read my forum post for further instructions: https://forum.vive.com/topic/3420-anyone-had-a-go-at-getting-vrtk-working-with-the-wave-sdk/
